Godot hasn't had a big release game yet, but the engine is free, open-source, actively updated, takes no royalties, and offers a fresh take on game development.",

That said, while it can be a great option for 2D games, the monetization model has become expensive. Unity and Godot are free (unless you buy the Unity pro license) and, in my opinion, offer a better experience.",
